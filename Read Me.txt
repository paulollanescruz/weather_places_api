UI and UX design explanation:

I did a mobile first approach for this application because 
most of the travellers can have a limited space in their bags to carry a laptop.
And most of people travelling have their mobile phones for ease of access.

Also I did a simple dropdown design for this requirement, a set of buttons at the bottom
for more options that are already accessible using one hand just in case the traveller is
holding something on their other hand.

a scroll page result that can be browsed / scrolled using one hand and won't require both hands to navigate
to select the desired item.

Minimal information on the list so the tourist will get an insight of the result item.
